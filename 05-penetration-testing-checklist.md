# Penetration Testing Checklist

This document provides a checklist for manual security testing of the application. Use this alongside automated security testing (SAST, DAST, SCA).

## Pre-Test Setup

- [ ] Set up test environment (not production)
- [ ] Create test accounts for each role (Admin, Owner, Accountant, Staff, Auditor, Employee)
- [ ] Prepare intercepting proxy (Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP)
- [ ] Review application architecture and data flow

## Automated DAST Testing

Run OWASP ZAP integration tests before manual testing:

```bash
# Run DAST only (requires Docker)
./mvnw test -Dtest=ZapDastTest -Ddast.enabled=true

# Run full test suite including DAST
./mvnw test -Ddast.enabled=true

# Results saved to:
# - target/security-reports/zap-baseline-report.html
# - target/security-reports/zap-authenticated-report.html
```

The ZapDastTest performs:
- Baseline scan (login page, public pages)
- Authenticated scan (dashboard, transactions, reports, etc.)
- Passive vulnerability scanning
- Thresholds: 0 HIGH, max 5 MEDIUM alerts allowed

Note: DAST is automatically run in CI (GitHub Actions). Local runs require Docker.
